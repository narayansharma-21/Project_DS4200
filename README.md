# Project_DS4200

This is a visualization project dedicated for the partners of FriendshipWorks to help them receive more grant money in order to establish 
more friendships.

Included in this file are the different data sources that we used in order to come up with the different types of visualizations along side a 
notebook that was used to actually create the visualizations in Python's Altair. All of these files are within the `data/python_script` file. Besides
these files there are different auto-generated files that are not directly relevant to the contribution of the project except the `index.html` file. 
This file shows the entire source code for the entire website.

## How To Run 

In order to see the interactive visualizations, one would need to navigate to the setttings of this repository and then press the Pages tab
in order to run the website on their computer. Or one can press this [link](https://narayansharma-21.github.io/Project_DS4200/) which will also
show where all the different visualizations should be and our entire data report as well.
